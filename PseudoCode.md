*Start "Ham and Cheese Omelette"*
>Input pan size 
 >Get vital ingredients amount from table 1
  >Get proportional Ingredient values 

>Place pan on stove 
 >Pour oil on pan 
  >Set stove Temperature to very low 

>Crack egg(s) into pan with oil
 >Stir eggs with spatula until yokes and egg whites are a homogeneous mixture
  >Decrease egg white size until they are not visable 
  
>Add in non-vital ingredients to taste from Table 2 
 >If the Omelette is going to be spicy  
  >Then Add a small amount of hot sauce 
   >Stir egg(s)/Spices until all are a homogeneous mixture
